### ВІТАННЯ КРАЄХОДЦЯМ

Краєходці — це науково-фантастична рольова гра про шукачів пригод, найманців та вигнанців, що намагаються розбагатіти в найжорсткіших окраїнах галактики. Гра задумана так, щоб в неї легко можна було зіграти одну зустріч з мінімальною підготовкою, але в той же час вона могла потягнути і невеличку кампанію..

Персонажі гравців в Краєходцях володіють невеликим зорельотом в часи, коли людство розселилось велитенською кількістю світів. Разом вони досліджують всесвіт, виконують вигідні замовлення та долають небезпеки.

Ви будете подорожувати планетами та братись за роботу, за яку інші не візьмуться. Ви будете битись з безжальними піратами, досліджувати покинуті станції та зіткнитесь віч на віч з химерними позапланетними істотами. І все заради того, щоб мати достатньо коштів на наступну подорож. Ви будете долати незгоди тримаючись на волоску від смерті, але зрештою ставати все сильнішими. В довгих подорожах ваші персонажі будуть пізнавати один одного і зростати разом.

Перша частина книжки опише загальні правила, котрим має слідувати кожен. Друга частина адресована тільки майстру гри та містить правила та настанови щодо гри як для одиночної зустрічі, так і для кампанії.

### ПРАВИЛА ГРИ

#### ЩО НЕОБХІДНО ДЛЯ ГРИ

Для гри в Краєходців вам потрібно:

- Ці правила
- Від двух до чотирьох друзів
- Декілька шестигранних кубиків. Досить буде двух, але краще, щоб у кожного гравця було по парі.
- Олівці та папір
- По листу персонажа для кожного гравця, а також один лист корабля. Ви можете знайти їх тут: **chrispwolf.com/offworlders***

#### РОЗМОВА

Гра в Краєходцях — це перш за все розмова. Майстер гри описує ситуацію навколо персонажа гравця та наповнює її людьми та деталями. Гравці ж у відповідь описують як діють їх персонажі, можливо уточнюють в майстра деталі, а також озвучують, що їх персонажі кажуть іншим персонажам.


Ви будете діяти по-черзі, в тій же мірі як в розмові ви висловлюєтесь по-черзі. Часом хтось буде говорити довше, а часом потрібно буде відступити і дати слово іншому.

На відміну багатьох інших ігор, тут не потрібно робити формальних ходів в чіткому порядку. Гра має йти природньо і нехай той, хто в центрі подій опише дії свого персонажа, а якщо він занадто довго в центрі уваги, то хай гравець передасть слово іншому.

#### ОСНОВНІ ТЕРМІНИ

Наступні терміни мають своє значення в грі і будуть використовуватись протягом опису правил.

**Гравець:** Один з тих, хто грає в гру, включаючи майстра гри.

**Майстер гри, або просто майстер:** Гравець, що відповідає за ігровий світ та тих персонажів, що не контролюються іншими гравцями.

**Персонаж:** Будь-яка вигадана особа у грі, під контролем гравця чи майстра.

**Персонажі майстра:**
Персонажі під контролем майстра. Союзники та вороги персонажів гравців, а також всі неважливі цивіли та другорядні персонажі світу.

**Персонажі гравців:** Головні герої гри. Кожен гравець контролює свого персонажа та описує їх роздуми, слова та дії.

**Атрибут:** Число, зазвичай від -1 до +3, що визначає загальні вміння персонажа гравця в деякій обсласті. В грі є чотири атрибута, про них трохи згодом.

**Вміння:** Одне з тих вмінь у грі, котрими можуть володіти чи не володіти пероснажі гравців. Вони відображають кваліфікації в деякій вузькій області експертизи. Персонажі гравців починають з двума вміннями.

**Здоров'я:** Число, що відображає фізичну стійкість персонажа гравця. Коли персонаж отримує пошкодження, його значення здоров'я зменшується.

**Талант:** Спеціальна дія чи трюк, котрі може виконати пероснаж. Кожен персонаж гравця починає з двума талантами.

**Кидок кубів:** Коли персонаж гравця має здійснити щось небеспечне, змагається з кимось чи результат загалом непевний, гравець має здійснити кидок кубів, як описано нижче.

**К6:** Один шестигранний кубик. Зазвичай вам потрібно буде кинути два таких і до сумми додати атрибут. Іноді потрібно буде кинути тільки один.

**ПД:** Пункти досвіду. Протягом гри персонажі будуть заробляти пункти досвіду, щоб потратити їх на нові таланти чи щоб покращити атрибути.

#### КИДАЄМО КУБИКИ

Коли персонаж гравця займається чимось небезпечний, коли він змагається з кимось чи результат дій непевен, зверніться до ігрових кубиків щоб дізнатись як добре йдуть справи. Потрібно буде кинути кості, додати до сумарного результата значення підходящого атрибуту і використати результат, щоб визначити що станеться далі.

###### 1. ОПИШІТЬ ЩО ВИ ХОЧЕТЕ ДОСЯГТИ І ЯКИМ ЧИНОМ

Якщо майстер вирішить, що це може бути ризиково чи успіхи досить сумнівні, щоб кидати куби, то перейдіть до кроку 2. Інашке майстер опише що сталось далі.

###### 2. ВИБЕРІТЬ НАЙБІЛЬШ ПІДХОДЯЩИЙ З ЧОТИРЬОХ АТРИБУТІВ

Зазвичай це рішення очевидне, але якщо ні — останнє слово за майстром.

###### 3. ОГОВОРІТЬ МОЖЛИВІ НАСЛІДКИ

Що станеться у випадку провалу? Якими можуть бути ускладнення? Тут за бажанням ви можете відступити чи обрати іншу стратегію. Майстер не зобов'язаний сказати що саме може далі трапитись, але він має бути чесним про маштаб можливих наслідків, щоб гравці розуміли серйозність ситуації.

###### 4. КИДАЙТЕ КУБИ!

Киньте **2к6**, складіть випавші значення та додайте підходящий атрибут. Сумарний результат визначить наскільки сприятливою буде розвитой ситуації.

**ПРИ 10 АБО ВИЩЕ:** Успіх. Ви добились чого хотіли.

**ПРИ 7-9:** Ускладнення. Загалом ви добились бажаного, проте нелегкою ціною, в недостатній мірі, ставши перед важким вибором чи отримавши ушкодження. Майстер визначить перед чим саме.

**ПРИ 6-:** Провал. Ви ймавірно не тільки не добились бажаного, але майстер ще й ускладнить ваше життя якимось чином. Але є і добрі новини, ви отримаєте 1 досвід!

**ЯКЩО ВИПАЛИ ДВІ ШІСТКИ**, це означає критичний успіх. Ви отримуєте що хотіли, а також щось понад те! Вам з майстром варто обговорити якийсь слушний бонус чи додатковий ефект.

Якщо у вас є підходяще вміння, ви можете перекинути один кубик, але ти маєш використати останній кидок.  

Майстер гри не має здійснювати кидки. Гравець - з завжди кидає. 

Only Roll When It’s Interesting.
Don’t ever roll when a character does
something that they could reasonably
accomplish without trouble, or if there
are no interesting consequences for
failure. Conversely, don’t roll if a char-
acter attempts something impossible.
It just doesn’t work. The sweet spot is
when it’s something the character could
potentially do, but it’s going to be tricky.

Nothing Never Happens. No matter
what the outcome is, rolling the dice
always changes the fictional situation.
On a success, the PC accomplishes
their goal and the game moves for-
ward. On a complication or a miss, the
situation escalates and becomes more
interesting.

#### ATTRIBUTES

Every PC has four attributes, representing different ways they might address challenges. Each attribute has
a rating between -1 and +3. The higher the rating, the more likely the character is to succeed when using it.
You’ll use these attributes when you roll the dice. The four attributes are:

**Strength:** Raw power, speed and ag-
gression. Useful for climbing, sprint-
ing, breaking things, and fighting in
melee. Strength also determines how
much punishment a PC can take.

**A gility:** Reaction time, control and
coordination. Useful for balancing

on narrow beams, flying starships
through asteroid fields, and shooting
rifles.

Intelligence: Perception, logic and
knowledge. Useful for analysis, mess-
ing with technology, and knowing
pertinent facts.

Willpower: Force of personality,
charisma and determination. Use it to
bark orders and manipulate people,
and resist the manipulations of enemy
psychics. Willpower also might just
keep you alive when all else is lost.

#### SKILLS

Each skill represents an area of trained expertise. Unlike attributes, skills do not have an associated number.
You either have a skill or you don’t. When you roll the dice and have an applicable skill, you may re-roll one
of the dice. You must accept the second result.

**Athletics:** Running, climbing, jump-
ing, swimming etc.

**Culture:** Knowledge of people, places,
etiquette, and history across many worlds.

**Manipulation:** Getting others to do
what you want, through lying, charm
or coercion.

Pilot: Controlling vehicles, from
starships and speeders to motorboats
and bicycles.

Science: Biolog y, physics, chemistry, etc.

Sneak: Passing unseen, sleight of
hand, picking pockets.

Survival: Finding food, air, shelter, di-
rections, etc. in hostile environments.

Tech: Computer software and complex
engineering.

#### ABILITIES

A player character in Offworlders starts with two abilities, and may get more as time goes on. An ability
is a special trick, stunt, or talent that allows the PC to do something special or bend the rules. Each ability
describes how and when it is applicable. The abilities are divided into four character classes, described in
Making an Offworlder, on the next page.

Some powerful abilities require the player to roll the dice to be used successfully.

#### MAKING AN OFFWORLDER

Follow this process to create your PC:

###### 1.PICK A CLASS

There are four classes: **Warrior** , **Out-
law, Geek** , and **Psychic**. Pick one.

Your class gives you a few unique **abil-
ities** to choose from. Pick any two.

###### 2.CHOOSE YOUR SKILLS

Choose any **two skills** for your character.

###### 3.ASSIGN YOUR ATTRIBUTES

Assign each of these numbers to one
of your attributes, in any order you
wish: **+2** , **+1** , **0** , and **-1**. Think about
your class, and what kind of things
your character is likely to be doing as
a guideline for which attributes you
want to make high, and which you can
afford to make lower.

###### 4.RECORD YOUR HEALTH

Each PC has maximum Health equal
to **12** plus their **Streng th** and **A gilit y**
attributes. For example, a PC with **+
Strength** and **+1 A g ility** has **15 Health**.
A PC with **0 Strength** and **-1 A g ilit y**
has **11 Health.**

###### 5.GET YOUR GEAR

You start with 3 Supply. Supply is an
abstract amount, representing any items
you might be carrying. Gear is explained
in Money, Weapons and Gear, on page 11.

- You start with **3 Credits**
- You start with one **light weapon**.
    Describe it.
Then choose either:
- An additional **7 credits**
    **OR**
- **Light Armor** worth 1-armor and a
    second weapon of any type.

###### 6. NAME AND DESCRIBE YOUR CHARACTER

Come up with a name for your charac-
ter, and share it with the other players.
Also come up with at least one distinct
visual detail that describes them. It
can be a clothing item, or something
about their body or possessions.
Anything that will help everyone start
getting a picture of your character in
their imagination.

###### CUSTOMIZING CLASSES

Experienced players may want more
flexibility when it comes to mak-
ing a character. If everyone agrees,
players may ignore the listed class-
es entirely, and make a character
simply by choosing any two skills,
and any two special abilities. Play-
ers should communicate to make
sure they don’t overlap too much.

###### ALIENS

Offworlders doesn’t have specific rules
for alien species. As a group, you
should decide amongst yourselves if
intelligent aliens exist in your uni-
verse. If a player really wants to be an
alien, let them. Maybe all Psychics are
from the same species, or the Warrior
learned their skills because they are a
member of a clannish, warlike species.
Often, humanoid aliens in science fic-
tion are fundamentally just people that
fit into specific tropes and archetypes.

###### GEEK

Geeks are doctors, scientists and technicians. Their abilities allow them
to manipulate technology, heal their teammates and offer additional
insight. Play a Geek if you want to be the smartest one in the room.

ABILITIES:
**Analytical:** W hen you encounter a
new situation, area or character,
you may ask the GM any one simple
question about the objects, people, or
surroundings. If the answer is some-
thing you could possibly perceive, the
GM must answer you honestly.

**Chemist:** You may spend 1 supply to
produce a single dose or use of a med-
icine, chemical, poison, or biological
agent. Give it a name and purpose,
and decide with the GM exactly how
it works. The GM has final say on its
effects and potential side effects or
drawbacks.

Drone Controller: You have a small
flying drone that you can control
remotely and perceive through. If it is
destroyed or lost, you can make a new
one with a few days of downtime.

Hijack: You can attempt to remotely
take over any electronic machine or
computer that you can see. Roll the
dice with Intelligence to do it.

Medic: When you perform first aid,
heal an additional +2 Health. When
others get a night’s rest in your pres-
ence, they roll 1D6 and heal that much
additional Health.

Polymath: Get a third skill

###### OUTLAW

Outlaws are smugglers, scoundrels, and jacks-of-all-trades. Their abil-
ities revolve around being sneaky, lucky, or ruthless. Play an Outlaw if
you want to get in and out of trouble.

ABILITIES:
**Cheap Shot:** If you attack an unaware
or surprised enemy, you can roll the
attack as though you were skilled,
rerolling one of the dice if you wish. If
successful, do maximum possible dam-
age for your weapon, ignoring armor.

**Ghost:** If you hold still in a hiding
spot, no one will find you until you
reveal yourself.

**Reckless:** When you charge into a
dangerous situation without regard for
your safety or the safety of others, get
**+1** to your next roll.

Lucky: Once per session, you may count
any miss ( 6- ) as a partial success ( 7-9 ), or
a partial success as a total success ( 10+ ).

Shoot First: You cannot be surprised.
If someone would surprise you, you get
the jump on them instead. You always
act first in a fight.

Smuggle: If you put any object some-
where it could reasonably be hidden,
(a handheld object on your person, or a
larger object on a ship, etc.) no one will
be able to find it.

###### WARRIOR

Warriors are soldiers and bounty hunters. All their abilities provide an edge
in combat. Play a Warrior if you want to be straightforward and violent.

ABILITIES:
**Brute:** You deal +2 damage with
melee weapons.

**Dead Eye:** You deal +2 damage with
ranged weapons.

**Hardy:** Add 4 to your Health.

Heavy Lifting: You can move deftly
and without penalty while using heav y
weapons and armor.

Unstoppable: You have +1 armor
at all times.

Veteran’s Instincts: Once per battle,
re-roll a damage die, either damage you
are dealing or damage dealt to you.

###### PSYCHIC

Psychics possess supernatural mental abilities. Their abilities al-
low them to manipulate their surroundings and read minds.
Play a Psychic if you want to be strange and powerful.

ABILITIES:
**Blast:** Your can use your psychic pow-
ers as a ranged weapon, doing **1D6 +**
damage to a nearby target. You attack
by rolling the dice with Willpower.

**Force Wall :** As long as you concen-
trate on nothing else, you can create a
strong barrier of solid psychic energy
up to 10x10 feet in size. If it comes
under sustained stress, you may have
to roll the dice with Willpower to
maintain it.

**Jump:** Once per scene, you may tele-
port instantly to a near by location that
you can see.

Premonition: Once per day, ask the
GM about the outcome of an immedi-
ate action. “What will happen when I
open this door?” for instance. They will
describe the likely outcome honestly.

Scanner: You can easily read people’s
surface emotions. You may roll the
dice with Intelligence to try and access
a character’s deeper thoughts or spe-
cific information.

Telekinesis: You can easily move
small objects with your mind. You
can attempt to move larger objects, or
move things very precisely, but it is
difficult. The GM will tell you how.

#### FIGHTING & DAMAGE

Resolve fights just like any other risky situation. When a player attacks an enemy who is prepared to defend
themselves, they should almost always be rolling the dice to do it. When an enemy opens fire on a player, the
player will likely be rolling the dice to avoid the attack or counter it somehow. There is no formal structure of
turns or rounds. Simply follow the action as it unfolds, shifting focus from character to character naturally and
resolving their actions.

When a player takes damage, it will
usually be because of a miss or a com-
plication. Outside of a fight, a PC might
take damage from other dangerous sit-
uations, like falling into a lake of acid,
being in the vacuum of space without
a suit, or being exposed to dangerous
radiation.

When players damage NPC’s, they
inflict damage as indicated by the type
of weapon they are using. For instance
a heav y weapon does **1D6+2** damage.
Meaning the player should roll a **D6** ,
add **2** to the total, and inflict that much
damage to the enemy.

Enemies and hazards inflict damage
against PC’s in the same way. Roll for
damage and subtract the result from a
PC’s health. In the GM section of these
rules is a selection of enemies, includ-
ing how much damage they should do.

###### HEALTH & DYING

Health is a measure of how much
damage a character can take before
they are in serious trouble. Both PC’s
and NPC’s have a health score.

When an NPC reaches 0 health , they
are out of action. Either dead, seriously
wounded, or unconscious, depending
on the fictional circumstances and the
desires of the attacker.

When a PC reaches 0 health , they are
in serious trouble. They must Roll The
Dice with the results below. They add
their Willpower to the roll.

10+: They are down for now, but with
rest and care, will make a full recovery.

7-9: They will live, but the player must
choose some part of the character
that gets lost forever. For example the
steadiness in their hands, their sense
of security, or their left eye. This has
no direct mechanical effect, but might
make life difficult or complicate cer-
tain situations in the future.

6-: The PC is doomed. They might not
die right away, and they might get a
chance to do one last thing before they
go, but they will not live to the end of
the game session.

###### ARMOR

Armor mitigates incoming damage. In
the Gear section, armor is listed as hav-
ing A r mor-1 , A r mor-2 , etc. If a charac-
ter is wearing armor, they subtract their
total armor amount from any incoming
damage. If the total damage is equal to
or lower than the armor rating, all the
damage is negated.

A character may not wear more than
one type of armor.

###### RECOVERING HEALTH

There are two ways to recover health:

First Aid: If you have a few quiet min-
utes, you can spend 1 Supply to heal
another character 1D6 of Health.

Resting: If a character gets the
equivalent of a good night’s sleep, they
recover Health equal to half their
max imum Health , rounded up.

#### MONEY, WEAPONS, AND GEAR

In Offworlders, tracking every little piece of equipment and every penny spent by the characters is not neces-
sary. Most equipment is covered by a character’s Supply, which is an abstraction of the stuff they are carrying
with them. The basic unit of currency in Offworlders is the Credit. One Credit represents a relatively substan-
tial amount of money, and should be the smallest unit of currency you track. We assume that the characters
can afford basic meals, cheap lodgings, etc, as long as they are not completely broke. Use the list below to
determine general prices.

###### THINGS WORTH ONE CREDIT

- A light weapon
- A substantial bribe
- An opulent night out, including
    food, entertainment, and lodging
- A few weeks rent in a middle-range
    apartment

###### MORE EXPENSIVE ITEMS

A new space suit 3C
A medium weapon 2C
A heavy weapon 5C
Passage to another world 7C
Passage to a nearby star system 12C
An average ground car 25C
A starship upgrade 50C
A simple helicopter 75C
A hover tank 200C
A new, bare-bones starship 500C
A small space station 5,000C

###### SUPPLY

Characters in Offworlders are
assumed to be carrying a variety of
useful and necessary tools. Instead of
choosing exactly what your character
is carrying ahead of time, these tools
are abstracted as Supply. You begin
with 3 Supply. You can spend 1 Supply
at any time to produce a mundane
item from the list below, or an item of
similar complexity if the GM agrees.
You refill your supply whenever you
have some downtime on board the
ship, or wherever you currently keep
all your stuff. Your maximum supply
is always 3.
You can spend 1 Supply to have one
of the following or an item of similar
complexity:

- 50 feet of cable
- A blowtorch
- A small explosive
- A multitool
- A motion detector
- An environmental scanning device

###### HEAVY ITEMS

Some weapons and items are “ heav y .”
These items are large or clumsy, and
it is difficult to move while carrying
them. A PC must take -1 any time
they roll the dice to do something like
run, jump, or climb while carrying a
heav y item. A heav y item will also be
very difficult to hide, and will attract
attention.
Heav y may cause other complications
as well, at the GM’s discretion.

###### GEAR

WEAPONS C DAMAGE NOTES
Unarmed 0C Lower of 2D6 Kicks, punches.
Light 1C 1D6 Pistols, knives. Easily hidden.
Medium 2C 1D6+1 Rifles, shotguns, swords.
Heavy 5C 1D6+2 Plasma cannons, sniper rifles, huge swords.
Heavy.

ARMOR C DEFENSE NOTES
Light 3c 1-armor
Heavy 6c 2-armor Heavy.
Assault 40c 3-armor Heavy. Includes several hours' air supply and
built-in heavy weapon.

SHIP ITEMS C NOTES
Starship drive fuel 3C Per unit.
Starship upgrades 50C
Hull repairs 1C Repairs 2 Hull. Available in any port.

#### THE SHIP

The players begin with a small spaceship. It’s just about big enough for all of them to live on, with a few ad-
ditional passengers when necessary. The PC’s control the ship using their attributes and skills.

The ship is capable of flying between planets in a few hours, and of flying faster than light to traverse the
space between stars in a matter of weeks. It comes with a space suit for each PC.

###### CREATING THE SHIP

By default, the ship is a blank slate. It
has a small cargo hold, does **1D6** dam-
age, and has **15 Hull**. It has **0 A rmor**
and **4 Max Drive Fuel**. It begins the
game fully fueled.

To make the ship, the players simply
select two upgrades. All upgrades
will open new opportunities for the
players, and the type of jobs they get
will reflect their choices. For example,
a ship without **Luxury Passenger
Quarters** will not attract wealthy
passengers. A ship with a **Massive
Cargo Hold** will get the PC’s lucra-
tive shipping jobs carrying large and
unusual cargo.

These rules represent smaller
starships like light freighters, frigates,
and corvettes, about 50 meters in
length. The ship is large enough for
everyone to live in together comfort-
ably, but no larger.

Of course, the players should choose a
name for their ship. Something like _The
Desert Rose_ , _Good Grief_ , or _Null Gravitas_.

###### SHIP UPGRADES

When you make your ship, choose 2 of
the following. Upgrades marked with an
asterisk (*) may be taken twice, provid-
ing a cumulative bonus. Otherwise each
upgrade may only be purchased once:

Additional A rmor: +1 armor*

Advanced Drive: For each interstellar
trip, you can choose either to take half
the time or use half the amount of fuel.
Round up.

Advanced Electronics: High-end
scanners, communicators, sen-
sors, etc. They will provide detalied
information about ships, places, and
stations you encounter.

A fterburners: You may spend 1 Drive
Fuel to get +1 to a single roll to evade,
outrun, or maneuver while piloting
the ship.

Fuel Tanks: Max Drive Fuel +.

High Maneuverability: If you don’t
have the Pilot skill, you count as
having it in situations where maneu-
verability is relevant. If you already
have the pilot skill, you may choose
to reroll both dice in these situations,
instead of just one.

Luxury Passenger Quarters: They come
with gourmet nutrition options and
beautiful decor. For the crew who wants
to attract a certain class of clientele.

Massive Cargo Hold: Large enough to
transport smaller vehicles or a huge
amount of goods.

MedBay: Advanced automated med-
ical equipment. Can put people into
stasis and, with time, heal even the
most grievous wounds. Characters
resting in a medbay overnight heal all
their HP instead of half their total. If a
character falls to 0HP they can choose
to wait to Roll the Dice to learn their
fate. If they make it to a MedBay with-
in a few minutes, they get +1 to the roll.

More powerful weapons: +1 damage*

Shuttle Hangar: Comes with a small
shuttle which can fly independently, but
cannot travel between stars on its own.

Additional ship upgrades may be
bought in play for 50 Credits each
while the ship is in port.

###### CONTROLLING THE SHIP

Other than **Damage** , **Hull** , and **A rmor** ,
the ship does not have attributes of its
own. Players control the ship with their
own attributes and skills, rolling the
dice in dangerous situations.

Ship combat works the same way as
combat among individuals. When a
ship is damaged, subtract damage
from its **Hull**.

When a ship reaches **0 Hull** , it is dis-
abled and at the mercy of its enemies or
the elements. Critical ship systems may
be dangerously malfunctioning.If a
person is unlucky enough to be hit with
a ship’s weapons, multiply the total
damage by **5**. Small arms carried by
people are incapable of inflicting signif-
icant damage to a starship’s **Hull**.

###### TRAVEL

On your ship, you can travel between
planets and other locations in the
same star system easily. It takes a few
hours, or days at most.

Travel between star systems takes
longer, and uses drive fuel. When you
travel to another system, the GM will
tell you how much time and drive fuel
it takes. It takes one week and one unit
of drive fuel to travel between the clos-
est neighboring star systems.

While stuck together on long journeys,
PC’s can also learn about each other
and earn XP. See Character Advancement.

###### MAINTENANCE

At a suitable spaceport, Hull damage
can be repaired at a cost of 1 credit per
2 points of Hull. Damage to specific
systems or critical areas of the ship may
cost much more, at the GM’s discretion.

Drive fuel costs 3 credits per unit,
and is available in any reasonably
equipped port.

#### CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT

If you play multiple sessions of Offworlders, your characters will become more powerful and effective.
Characters earn XP each session, and may then spend XP on advancements.

###### EARNING XP

Characters earn XP in three ways:

ROLLING MISSES
Any time a player **Rolls the Dice** and
the final result is **6** or less, their char-
acter earns **1 X P.**

END OF SESSION QUESTIONS
At the end of each session of play, an-
swer the following three questions, as
a group. For each question answered
with a “yes,” every PC gets **1 X P.**

Did we earn a profit?
Did we discover something new and inter-
esting about the universe?
Did we overcome a difficult challenge or
dangerous adversary?

DURING LONG TRIPS
When the characters are on a long trip
together through space, they tend to
learn a lot about each other.

Each time the characters travel
between star systems, or otherwise
spend multiple days together in a
small space, go around the table and
give each player a turn, starting with
the player to the left of the GM.

On their turn, each player must ask
another player a question about their
character. It could be about that
character’s past, or their goals, or just
something about their personality. If
that player answers the question hon-
estly, they earn 1XP.

Players should take care to ensure that
everyone at the table gets a chance to
answer a question.

The questions do not have to be asked or
answered in character, but the players
should discuss how their characters
learned about each other on the trip.

The GM does not ask a question.

###### SPENDING XP: ADVANCEMENTS

When a PC has at least 10XP, and some
downtime, they can spend XP to get
one of the following advancements
by paying its associated cost. Each
advancement may only be taken once,
but they may be taken in any order:
Get a new class ability 10XP
Get a new class ability 10XP
Get a new class ability 10XP
Increase an attribute by 1 (Max +2) 10XP
Increase an attribute by 1 (Max +2) 10XP
Increase an attribute by 1 (Max +3) 20XP

When the PC’s get close to maxing out
their advancements, the players and GM
should have a discussion about how to
bring the ongoing campaign to a satisfy-
ing conclusion. Are the characters ready
to retire? How have they changed the
universe in their travels? Give yourselves
enough time to tie up the narrative.

It can be fun to start a new campaign
after the current one ends, playing a dif-
ferent crew in the same shared universe.



The the following sections are addressed to the
game master. If you’re planning on being the game
master for your group, you should read it. If you’re
not planning on being a game master, you don’t
have to read it, but you might fi nd it interesting.

### THE GAME MASTER

#### YOUR GOALS

As the GM, you have three primary goals. Everything you do should be in
service of one of them.

###### PORTRAY A DANGEROUS AND EXCITING SCI-FI UNIVERSE

Laser beams glitter in the darkness.
Pirate Cruisers cut across the rings
of a gas giant. A derelict vessel offers
mysteries to be solved, but something
dangerous lurks in its halls. Fill your
imagination with images of starships,
futuristic cities, and dangerous
frontier worlds. Present the universe
to your players with pointed details
and evocative description. Make it feel
amazing but real.

###### FILL THE CHARACTERS’ LIVES WITH CONFLICT AND ADVENTURE

An outlaw in a smoky space station
bar offers a job with a payout too good
to be true. A customs vessel closes in,
scanning for the contraband on board.
In the alley ways of a world-spanning
metropolis, a violent gang surrounds
the characters. Keep things moving,
keep pushing against the players. Give
them things to do and people to inter-
act with. Push them into action, then
follow up with what they do.

###### PLAY TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS

Don’t come in with a whole story
planned out. You might have a job
outlined, and some NPC’s ready to go,
but get ready to change things and
make things up as you go. When your
players roll the dice they’ll be creating
complications and inviting chaos. Let
them. If you try to wrangle them into
a pre-planned story, the game will
fight you. Let your players impact what
happens. It’s their story after all.

#### THINGS YOU SHOULD DO

###### ASK QUESTIONS AND USE THE ANSWERS

Offworlders leaves a lot unanswered.
How does faster than light travel work?
How do people treat psychics? Do
weapons fire lasers or bullets? These
are basic setting questions that you
can decide with your players, or simply
ask them to answer. Let the player
playing a Warrior decide that their
heav y weapon shoots bolts of super-hot
plasma, or ask the Geek about drive
fuel. This extends to specific ques-
tions about their characters too. Ask
the Outlaw about the last crime they

committed, and the psychic about
their place in society. Answering these
questions as a group will create a uni-
verse you all own together.

As the GM, use the answers to these
questions later. What happens when
a bolt of superheated plasma burns
through a barrel of drive fuel? Who’s
coming after the Outlaw? Moment to
moment action and even whole ses-
sions of play can come from here.

###### PROMPT THE PLAYERS AND LET THINGS SNOWBALL

Constantly present the players with
pressure and danger, and opportuni-
ties for profit. Show them the coming
danger, the money on the table, the
barrel of the laser pistol, the asteroid
barrelling towards the ship, then
ask, “What do you do?” The players
will spring into motion, taking risky
actions, and rolling the dice. The situa-
tion will tend to escalate and shift. Let
it! Respond to player actions and carry
the narrative through.

###### RESPOND TO THE DICE

Much of your work will be to take the
results when the players roll the dice
and interpret them into interesting
narrative consequences. Your players
will be hitting the 7-9 area a lot, and
you’ll have to come up with tradeoffs
and consequences on the fly. That’s
why step 3 in Rolling The Dice is so
important. If everyone has a good idea
about potential outcomes before the
dice hit the table, it will help things go
smoothly. When your players roll 7-9,
offer them tough choices and use up
their resources (health, supply, etc.).
Allow dice rolls to snowball and build
on one another:

_“You manage to blast the pirate with your
shotgun, but not before he gets a hit in. Take
1D6 damage.”_

_“You can repair the life support systems on
the station, but you’ll have to spend 1 supply
to have the right tools on hand.”_

_“The fixer agrees to get you the documents
you asked for, but she’ll need some credits up
front to show you’re good for it.”_

On a miss, show the players how
their actions complicate and escalate
the situation, or put them directly
in danger. Use misses to damage or
destroy equipment, cause their ship
to malfunction, or hurt the players
directly. You have a huge amount of
influence over the difficulty of any
given situation. Play up damage and
danger for a grittier game, or make
the PC’s feel more heroic by using less
harsh consequences.

In all circumstances, use the stakes and
the situation established in the fiction
of the game to inform consequences.

###### ADJUDICATE ABILITIES FAIRLY

Some of the class abilities are quite
broad in scope, and can even be a little
vague. This is intentional. When there
is a question about where and how an
ability applies, you have final say, but
it should be a conversation at the table.
Try to be consistent, but flexible with
the details. It’s important to challenge
the players, but don’t try to cheat them
out of their abilities. They are meant to
be powerful, and the players should be
able to use them to do awesome things.

#### THE DIE OF FATE

Sometimes a situation will come up
that needs to be resolved, but you
don’t want to just decide yourself. For
example when two NPC’s are fighting
each other and you don’t know who
will win, or if the PC’s enter a danger-
ous system and you want to know if
pirates come looking for them. In these
situations, simply roll a D6. A high roll
indicates a positive result for the PC’s
and a low roll a negative one. You can
make this either a binary yes/no or
use degrees of goodness and badness,
depending on the situation.

Use the die of fate when it’s interesting
to not be in control of what happens,
and you don’t want to be responsible for
the answer. But if you decide to use it,
be sure to follow through on the result.

#### JOBS: A FRAMEWORK FOR YOUR

#### SESSION

When starting a session of Offworlders, you need to be ready with events that the players can respond to.
Because the players are troubleshooters, mercenaries and freebooters, we call this the Job. A job is a simple
list of events and facts, centered around a particular goal or problem. It should have just enough detail for you
to know where you are going and keep things moving, but be flexible enough so that you can respond to the
PC’s actions too. Additionally, write down several questions about the job that you are interested in answering
during play. Lastly, jot down some names, attributes, and any notes for NPC’s the PC’s are likely to encounter.

You can make the job as vague or
detailed as you want. Some GMs are
very improvisational, and some like to
be very prepared. You can always flesh
out additional details during play.
What you shouldn’t do is plan an exact
story, or try to predict exactly how the
PCs will solve the problem.

Start your first session with the first
job event. Describe where the players
are and what they are doing. Put an
obstacle directly in their way, or show
them an opportunity to engage with
the world. Invite them to start making
decisions and rolling the dice. See what
happens from there. When the action

starts to stall, look at another item on
the job list and bring it into play. De-
scribe to the players how it manifests,
and see how they react. Repeat this
process until the job is resolved.

###### JOB: SPECIAL DELIVERY

JOB EVENTS:
The PC’s are approaching Rego-
lith, a mining colony built into an
asteroid. Desperate for income,
they’ve accepted a job from a
mysterious contact to deliver a large
crate, unopened, into the hands of
a local rebel faction.

As they enter Regolith’s security
perimeter, a customs vessel hails
them and asks to come aboard to
inspect the vessel.
Their rebel contact is not waiting
for them at the meeting point out
on the surface of the asteroid.

The rebel headquarters, an aban-
doned mining station, is under
attack, and the rebels are pinned
down inside. If they want to get
paid, the PC’s will have to find a
way to get them the crate.

JOB QUESTIONS:

_- How will they circumvent customs?
- What’s in the crate?
- Who hired the PC’s?
- Will the PC’s sympathize with the_
    _rebels?_

NPCS HEALTH ARMOR DAMAGE ABOUT
Customs Officers:
Delilah & Hiro

3 1 1D6 Thorough, but cor-
ruptible
Rebel Agent: Shasta
Rafaella

6 1 1D6+1 A true believer with no
sense of humor.

#### CASH REWARDS

The PC’s are going to be looking for
ways to profit, to keep the ship flying
and to line their own pockets. As the
GM, it’s up to you to determine how
much NPC’s are willing to pay them
for their work and for any valuable loot
they might dig up.For a typical job that
lasts one session of game time, 30-50

credits is a pretty good range. Partic-
ularly lengthy, dangerous, or import-
ant jobs might pay up to 100 credits.
Making more than that from a single
job is unlikely.

Remember that new ship upgrades
cost 50 credits, and players will be

spending some credits on fuel and ship
repairs as they travel. Also remember
that the main reward in this game is
XP, so giving your players a little extra
money to throw around won’t break
anything too badly.

#### NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS

It’s easy to come up with NPC’s and creatures on the fly in Offworlders. The most important thing for NPC’s is
to make them feel human. Give them names and goals, and describe them in detail to the players. Use the
following guidelines to give them combat attributes, if necessary:

CHARACTER HEALTH ARMOR DAMAGE
Civilians, animals, generally untrained people 3 0 Lower of 2D6
Security guards and beat cops 3 1 1D6
Soldiers 6 1 1D6+1
Elite units, powerful aliens 8 2 Higher of 2D6+1
Huge monsters 16 3 2D6

#### NON-PLAYER STARSHIPS

Use these attributes to improvise encounters and conflicts with other ships.

SHIP HULL ARMOR DAMAGE
Attack frigates 8 1 1D6+2
Science vessels 4 0 0 (Unarmed)
Capital ships 16 4 2D6

Feel free to tweak and remix the attributes above to come up with new threats
and characters. Remember that enemies will react intelligently to outwit the
players, and will be unlikely to charge into a fight head on, or fight to the death
without a good reason.

#### THE LONG GAME: THE STAR MAP,  FACTIONS AND TIMELINES

If you play multiple sessions of Offworlders, you’ll need to expand your game’s universe beyond a single job
and location. To keep track of places and events in the game, you’ll create a star map and a timeline after
your first session.

###### THE STAR MAP

To start drawing the star map for your
campaign, follow these steps:

1 After your first session, get a blank
piece of paper. Somewhere near the
middle, draw a star. Draw it small
enough so you leave plenty of space on
the paper for other stars, but big enough
that you can write some things around
it without having to cram them in.

2 Next to the star, draw a dot. This is
the location where the PC’s first job
took place. Is it a planet? A moon? A
space station? Write the name of the
location there too.

3 Give the star a name. Something
like Amaterasu , or Hertzprung and
write it down. Think about who rules
this star system. Is it an interstellar
megacorporation? A religious empire?
A managed democracy? This is your
first faction.

4 Consider other locations in the
star system, and add one or two now.
Maybe a highly populated planet, or a
gas-mining station.

5 Does the faction ruling the star also
rule any other stars? If they do, those
are probably pretty close by. Add those
stars and name them, too. You can add
a location or two to each, if you wish.

6 Let your mind wander. Think about
other factions that might come into
conflict with the first. If they control
star systems, add new stars to the map.
You can draw political borders if it helps
keep track. You can add as much or as
little detail to these stars as you wish.
Add any locations that come to mind.

Leave space to add to your map. It’s
never truly complete. You can expand
it and add details as the players ex-
plore the universe.

Remember that the closest star sys-
tems take one week and one unit of
drive fuel for the players to reach. Far-
ther systems will take more time and
fuel. Use this information to tune the
scale and difficulty of travel between
stars on your map.

###### FACTIONS

Factions are the major movers and
shakers in the universe. Megacorpo-
rations, stellar empires, mercenary
companies, crime syndicates and the
like. The PCs are usually going to be
too small to be able to take on a faction
directly, but will encounter them
through NPCs and jobs.

Note factions on your map and give
them competing goals. You only really
need two to start, and can create seri-
ous intrigue with three or four. When
you create a faction, think about its
leaders and members. How is it struc-
tured, politically? When it goes to war,
what kind of soldiers does it have?

You’ll use factions as the driving forces
for your timelines, which will create
opportunities for jobs. When the PC’s
are doing a job, they are likely to inter-
act with agents of at least one faction.

###### TIMELINES

Much like a job is a framework for a
single session, timelines are frame-
works for your campaign. You should
make one timeline after you first make
your star map, and can add more as
the universe gets fleshed out.

To make a timeline, think about the
factions on your map, and the goals of
each. What is happening in the uni-
verse? How do the factions act against
one another? Who is doing what?

Then, write down a list of 3-5 events.
These are events that will happen in
the future, one after the other, bar-
ring some action by the players that
dramatically alters their course. This
is your timeline. A timeline should
escalate towards instability, with the
final event representing a fundamen-
tal change in the setting. For example:

Timelines start at the first event. Later
events happen either between ses-
sions, or as time passes. When the PC’s
spend a lot of time travelling, time-
lines will advance. Show the players
how the universe is changing as they
move through it. If event 4 in the ex-
ample timeline takes place, drive fuel
is likely to become more scarce and
expensive within the UDW.

Use timelines as the basis for creating
new jobs for each session. For example,
if event 2 occurs, will people be willing
to pay the PC’s to smuggle them off of
Hertzprung-9? Sounds like a golden
opportunity for a job.

Timelines are flexible and uncertain.
What if, in the course of job, the PC’s
prevent the terrorist bombing be-
fore event 2 takes place? The whole
timeline is likely to change. Feel free to
erase and rewrite timelines based on
what happens during play.

###### THE FUTURE

Both your star map and your timelines
are mutable and ever -growing. As you
and your players find out more about
the universe in play, new timelines
will suggest them selves, and new
locations will be fleshed out on the
map. Be tween sessions, think about
where things are going. Write new
timelines, daydream new planets and
draw them on the map.

Your players may develop specific goals
and interests as the campaign moves
forward. Encourage them! Allow them
to give you ideas for new jobs, loca-
tions and characters. As you grow the
universe, you can use the inspirational
tables below to generate new ideas
and situations. A Job doesn't have to
literally be a task done for money for
an employer. If the PC's develop their
own goals, you can use the job format
to plan out relevant challenges on a
session-by-session basis.

TIMELINE: DISUNION IN THE UDW

_1. Water riots on the mining colony Hertzprung-9 begin to escalate.
2. After a terrorist bombing, the Union of Democratic Worlds declares martial law on_
    _Hertzprung-9.
3. The UDW diverts fleet resources to the Hertzprung System as violence spreads.
4. Sensing weakness, the neighboring Tanagran Empire seizes a drive fuel production_
    _facility from the UDW.
5. War is declared between the Tanagran Empire and the UDW._


#### INSPIRATIONAL TABLES

Use the following tables to generate names, places, and ideas for jobs. You can just pick what sounds
interesting to you, or you can roll 2D6 on a table, using one die to determine the group and the second to
determine the specific item. Items from the tables can serve as the starting point for jobs or even campaigns,
or just as vibrant details the characters notice in passing.
